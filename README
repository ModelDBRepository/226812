This package contains the Genesis code for the simulations used
in 
Van Dijck G, Seidl K, Paul O, Ruther P, Van Hulle MM,  Maex R (2012) 
Enhancing the yield of high-density electrode arrays through automated 
electrode selection. Intl. J. Neural Systems 22, 1-19. 

These simulations were conducted with the genesis2.3 release, 
on MacPro running OSX.

For information and problems, please email Reinoud Maex at one

The program can be run in two ways:
- either running the whole network of 5 neurons: go to
dir Network_5neuron_IMTEK and type genesis Network.g
- or running a single neuron: go to the respective dir
(L5P37C, L5P37C-notuft, L5P37C-onlybasal) and type
genesis L5P37C.g (L5P37C_notuft.g, L5P37C_onlybasal.g).

The dirs of each of the respective neurons are self-contained.
For running the network the code has been made more modular:
- Electrodes contains all code relevant to the electrodes.
- Output contains all code for graphical or ascii-file output.
- Fibres contains all code concerning the wiring.
Finally, Granule_cell is only a subsidiary dir containing the 
code for the channels used by the inhibitory neurons.

Usually you will run the program in one of two modes: either
as a test using online graphical output (xcell, xgraph, etc)
or for the real simulation saving all output (membrane potentials,
electrode potentials, etc) to ascii files.
Selecting the mode can easily be done by (un-)commenting out
the respective genesis commands.
